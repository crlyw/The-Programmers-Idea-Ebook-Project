#Title: Add/Subtract/Multiply/Divide Fractions
####Difficulty: 5
####Description: 
This project involves working with fractions. How do you add ⅓ + ⅕? Create a##
program that first asks the user which operation they want to do: add, subtract, multiply or divide
and then asks for 1, 2 or more fractions to work with. The program prints out the result.

####Tips: 
Think about how you might divide up the fraction itself into its numerator and denominator.
Many of the operations involve finding a common denominator, getting its reciprocal and
possibly reducing a fraction to lowest terms. This would be much easier if you can isolate the
numerator from its denominator. You could also do this using a custom fraction class.
