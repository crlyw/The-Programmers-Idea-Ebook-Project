# Title: Binary to Decimal and Back Converter
#### Difficulty: 4
#### Description:
Make a program which has the user enter in either a decimal value and prints out
its binary equivalent or enter a binary value and it prints out the decimal equivalent value.

#### Tips:
Start testing with some low well known decimal and binary values to make sure that it is
first converting correctly. Use values you can easily calculate like 3, 4 and 5. Try taking a
number, dividing it by 2 (using integer division) and recording its remainder. Do remember that
N % 2 is always going to come out as either 1 or 0. Take the result of the divide and divide that
by 2 again. Keep doing this until you can no longer divide it by 2 (again using integer division).

#### Added Difficulty(Optional):
Try converting the value into Octal or a unit in some other base.

#### Technology Used
1. Java
